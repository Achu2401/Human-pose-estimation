Human pose estimation using machine learning is a crucial task in computer vision, enabling applications such as human-computer interaction, healthcare monitoring, sports analysis, and virtual reality. The problem involves identifying and locating key body joints (e.g., head, shoulders, elbows, knees) in images or video sequences to determine the human posture. Despite recent advancements, challenges remain in dealing with varying poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds.

Proposed Solution Diagram

 Input Layer: Accepts image frames or video streams from a camera or uploaded media.
 Preprocessing Unit: Enhances input data by resizing, normalizing, and applying augmentation techniques. 
 Pose Detection Model: Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., PoseNet or OpenPose)to detect key points and body joints. 
 Post-Processing: Analyzes detected key points to filter noise, apply smoothing, andcalculate pose-related metrics. 
 Output Module: Displays annotated skeletons over the input frame or outputs thedata for further applications, such as activity recognition.
